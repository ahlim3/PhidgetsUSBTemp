# PhidgetsUSBTemp

This program allows for the measurment of temperature data from the Phidgets Education Getting Started Kit using SwiftUI. 
It is a Mac-only app because of the use of a USB port. 

The program allows one to measure the temperature from the HUM1000_0 Humidity Phidget. The data can be saved as a text file. 

One must follow the necessary steps on the Phidgets website to use the Phidgets library podfile with this program.
